            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                "4000 Weeks" is a native Android application designed to reframe the concept of memory-keeping. In an age of cluttered digital photo galleries, this app encourages a more intentional approach by allowing users to save only one meaningful photo per week of their life. This constraint transforms a user's timeline from a random collection of images into a curated, week-by-week visual biography, helping them reflect on their most significant moments.

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure User Accounts:</strong> Full user registration and login system built with Firebase Authentication, ensuring each user's timeline is private and secure.</li>
